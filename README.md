 Exploring The Operational Efficiency for Traffic Department Efficiency

# Objective

The primary goal is to determine the closure rate of service requests and identify operational inefficiencies and areas for improvement within the Traffic Department.



   # Dataset
   The dataset used in this project, identified as 3-1-1-service-requests, was sourced from Open Data Vancouver. It comprises a variety of service requests handled by the City of Vancouver's Traffic Department, providing a detailed record of each request including identifiers, closure rates, and the types of requests made. This dataset is part of the city's initiative to enhance transparency and operational efficiency in government services.
